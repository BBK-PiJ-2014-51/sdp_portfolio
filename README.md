Exercises and coursework for Software Design and Programming

This repo contains my weekly execises in the Exercises folder as per moodle instructions.

It also contains my first coursework in the folder cw-one as per moodle instructions.

My cw-two and cw-three projects are not hosted in this repo. My partner has submitted the url of my cw-two project and another group member has submitted the url of my cw-three project.
I have not submitted the urls via moodle as per Keith's instructions.

The cw-two and cw-three folders are empty, save a url to the joint repos in readme files.
